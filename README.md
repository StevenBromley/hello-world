Change on Jan 16 for HW2. Hello again!

My name is Steven Bromley. I am a 3rd year PhD student at Clemson University working on studying charge exchange betwween singly and highly charged ions and neutrals in two apparatus': a time-of-flight mass spectrometer for radial extraction from Paul Traps, and a gas cell experiment for controlled neutralization of highly charged ion beams in noble gases.

In my free time, I enjoy reading a variety of genres and mountain biking. At some point within the next decade I would like to ride the Trans-America Bike Trail from the West to the East coast of the United States.
